# kJs' Payday 2 Mod Compilation

This is a compilation of Payday 2 Mods, this will completely alter the Payday 2 experience and will be something similar to the (Payday2 MVP Mod)[https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/downloads.php?do=file&id=16621].

The data used in these mods comes from Payday2 LUA files that have been decompiled (here)[https://github.com/mwSora/payday-2-luajit].

Provides the following modifications to the game:

- Always active ALL perks and perk decks (this is not visible in the UI but easily noticeable with perks like Transporter)
- Massively multiplied character movement speed
- God mode (uses a value for over 100% for dodge)
- Instant interaction
- Instant drills (the exception seems to be the Thermal Drill on Bank Heist, this drill is not instant)
- Keybind option for level 100 and 100 infamy 
- Keybind option for an achievement lock/unlock menu
- Infinite ECMs (this seems to work for only hosts)
- 99 Cable ties
